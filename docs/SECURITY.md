# Security

- The admin email, bcrypt password hash, and session signing secret come only
  from environment variables. Plaintext passwords are never configured.
- Session cookies are HMAC-signed, expire after eight hours, and use HttpOnly,
  SameSite=Strict, Path=/, and Secure in production.
- Every mutation checks the session on the server. CSRF defenses combine a
  per-browser token, configured-base-URL origin validation, SameSite cookies,
  and server actions. Vercel previews are accepted only for constrained
  HTTPS `*.vercel.app` forwarded hosts at the Vercel edge.
- Login failures are limited to five per source address per 15-minute window in
  each process. Add edge/shared limiting for multi-instance production.
- Zod validates titles, slugs, and HTTPS Kuula hosts and paths. Reserved route
  slugs cannot be saved; the database enforces slug uniqueness.
- CSP limits frames to exact `kuula.co` and `www.kuula.co` origins. Other
  security headers disable MIME sniffing and sensitive browser capabilities.
- All ordinary pages deny framing. `/embed/[slug]` deliberately allows framing
  from any site; drafts show an inaccessible state without a Kuula iframe.

Use HTTPS, rotate credentials when exposure is suspected, patch dependencies,
and restrict access to deployment secrets and database backups. There is no
password reset workflow: update the environment credentials and restart.
