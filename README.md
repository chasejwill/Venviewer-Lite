# Venviewer Lite

Venviewer Lite is a small, self-hosted manager and public viewer for Kuula
virtual tours. Version 1.0.0 provides one environment-configured administrator,
draft/published tours, direct public links, and embeddable viewers.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 22+, pnpm 11+, and SQLite.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
# Pipe your password without storing plaintext in the application:
printf '%s' 'your-long-password' | pnpm auth:hash-password
# Replace every placeholder in .env, including the generated hash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`. Tours remain unavailable on public and
embed routes until published. The optional example is added with
`pnpm db:seed`; it is always created as a draft.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — run the development server
- `pnpm db:migrate` — apply/create local SQLite migrations
- `pnpm db:push` / `pnpm db:generate` — synchronize development/generate client
- `pnpm db:migrate:deploy` — deploy production PostgreSQL migrations
- `pnpm db:migrate:deploy:sqlite` — deploy SQLite migrations when needed
- `pnpm db:seed` — add the development-only Falls of the Ohio draft
- `pnpm test` — run tests
- `pnpm verify` — formatting, lint, types, tests, and production build
- `pnpm build` — production PostgreSQL build

Production PostgreSQL deployment is documented in
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md). See
[docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup details and
[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) before exposing the application.
